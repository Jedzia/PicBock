The "Hallway" project seems to be an attempt to fight against procedural textures not willing to constrain on procedural geometry ... or something like that.

- **HallwayConceptA11high.png**: Environment, draft, no PBR
- **Codelock-PNG24T.png**: The only Alpha/BW texture the code-lock is made of.    
- **Hallway-Door_0009.png**: Door with aged surface and code-lock, draft render.
